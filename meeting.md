## Pre-Meeting Notes & Thoughts

- Explain MVP vs full website building.
- Emphasize importance of reaching MVP/prototype first, especially since there are no customers yet.
- Necessary requirement imo - something that validates you are real business, to me this is not a booking and payment system (yet).
- What should it looks like, whats the vibe. (wireframes)
